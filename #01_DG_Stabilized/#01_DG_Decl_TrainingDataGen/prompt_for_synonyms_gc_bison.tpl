I give you 3 examples of DG declarations about some chemical.
And then I give you another chemical and synonyms.
I want you to generate 10 new and verry different DG declarations absed on the target chemical and its synonym.
The new DG declarations should losely follow the pattern of the examples in terms of formulation, structure and fuzziness,
while 5 variants should name the chemical or synonym,
3 variants should contain typos and
5 variants shall not use the target chemical name or synonym but describe the target chemical by its properties, usage, or other indirect terms.
No duplicates.
Output should be a pythonic list of strings, like ["<DG declaraton>", "<DG declaraton>", ...]
No formating of the output allowd.

Example DG Declarations:
<style_examples>

Target chemical: <term>
Synonyms: <synonyms>
